# Animated scenes of London Bridge with background sound (written in C++)

I (with my group) have done this project during my undergrad Computer Graphics course. There are total 3 animated scenes to view. 
1. Day Mode; 
2. Evening Mode;
3. Night Mode

To run this code, first you have to install codeblocks. Then,

1. You have to setup openGL/glut to run this code.
   For openGL/glut setup please follow this link 
   https://dottheslash.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/setting-up-codeblocks-with-glut-for-windows/
2. Download the full repository (zip) and extract all the files and folders.
3. From the folder run poiuy.cbp using codeblocks.
4. There is a sound file included in the folder named "sound.wav"
   In 5236th line of the code change the sound file path as your folder placement.
   Please add the full path splitting using "\\\"  
   For example "C:\\\Users\\\User\\Downloads\\\Documents\\\9\\\cg lab\\\011172176_011172172_011172169\\\sound.wav"
5. For any other help feel free to email at srahman172176@bscse.uiu.ac.bd
